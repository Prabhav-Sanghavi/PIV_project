# PIV Project

This project implements Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) techniques using Python and OpenCV to analyze fluid flow from video data.

## Contents
- `PIV_file.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for extracting frames, applying contrast enhancement and FFT-based processing to compute velocity vectors.

## Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) for frequency-domain analysis

## Objective
To estimate and visualize velocity fields in fluid dynamics videos using image processing and PIV methods.

## How to Run
1. Install required packages:

2. Launch the notebook:

3. Ensure video files are available and paths are correctly set inside the notebook.
